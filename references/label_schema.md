## Valence-Arousal Representation (v1)

Each vocalization can be represented as a point in the Valence-Arousal (VA) 2D space:

- **Valence**: Positive (pleasant/playful) → Negative (stress/distress)
- **Arousal**: High (alarm, attention-seeking) → Low (neutral, calm)

Discrete labels (Contact / Alarm / Distress / Neutral / Playful) can be mapped approximately into this VA space for convenience, but the main goal is to have continuous VA values.
