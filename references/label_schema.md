## Valence-Arousal-Social Engagement (VAS) Representation
Each vocalization is represented as a point in a continuous affective space.

### Valence–Arousal (VA) Dimensions

Valence reflects the emotional polarity of a vocalization:
- **Positive**: pleasant, playful, affiliative
- **Negative**: stress-related, discomfort, distress

Arousal reflects the level of physiological and behavioral activation:
- **High**: alarm calls, attention-seeking, agitation
- **Low**: calm, neutral, relaxed states

Discrete vocalization categories (e.g., Contact, Alarm, Distress, Neutral, Playful) can be approximately mapped into the VA space for interpretability.  
However, the primary objective of this project is to model emotions as **continuous VA values**, enabling finer-grained representation beyond discrete classes.

### Social Engagement Dimension (Third Axis)

In addition to Valence and Arousal, we introduce **Social Engagement** as a third continuous dimension.

Social Engagement captures the extent to which a vocalization is directed toward initiating or maintaining social interaction with a conspecific or human caregiver, rather than reflecting an internal or purely environmental response.

- **High Social Engagement**: contact calls, attention-directed vocalizations, calls with apparent expectation of response
- **Low Social Engagement**: self-regulatory vocalizations, environmental reactions, non-directed alarm or distress calls

This dimension is particularly relevant for parrots, which are highly social and communicative animals whose vocalizations often serve interactive rather than purely emotional functions.

### Innovation

While traditional animal emotion modeling typically relies on Valence–Arousal representations alone, the inclusion of Social Engagement allows Chirp to distinguish vocalizations with similar affective intensity but different communicative intent.

This extension addresses a key limitation of VA-only models when applied to socially complex species such as parrots and represents a step toward more ecologically valid emotion interpretation.
